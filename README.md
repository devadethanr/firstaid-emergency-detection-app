# firstaid-emergency-detection-app

1. **Flask App Setup**:
   - Create a new Flask application and set up the basic structure (routes, templates, static files, etc.).
   - Implement the user authentication system (login, register, guest user) using Flask-Login or a similar library.

2. **CNN Model Integration**:
   - Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect medical emergencies based on images of wounds or animal bites, and text-based symptoms.
   - Train and evaluate the model using a suitable dataset.
   - Integrate the CNN model into your Flask app, allowing users to upload images and enter symptom information.

3. **Video Solution Delivery**:
   - Create a database of pre-recorded videos that correspond to different medical emergencies.
   - Implement a system to retrieve and display the appropriate video based on the detected emergency and symptoms.

4. **Live Data Collection and Storage**:
   - Integrate multiple sensors (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, temperature) to collect live data during the emergency detection process.
   - Store the collected sensor data in a MongoDB database for future analysis and reporting.

5. **Alert System**:
   - Implement a mechanism to send alert messages to the nearest hospital and police station when the detected symptoms are deemed dangerous.
   - Utilize a messaging service or API (e.g., SMS, email, push notifications) to deliver the alerts.

6. **User Interface (UI) and Responsive Design**:
   - Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface for your Flask app.
   - Ensure the app is mobile-friendly and provides a consistent user experience across different devices.

7. **Database Integration**:
   - Set up a MongoDB database to store user accounts, emergency detection data, and any other relevant information.
   - Integrate the MongoDB database with your Flask app using a library like PyMongo.
